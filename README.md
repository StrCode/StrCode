# Hey there

I'm [Samuel](#), a software engineer based in Nigeria.

I love building things and solving problems.

I'm a big believer in learning by doing. My repositories are a mix of production projects and experiments where I test new technologies, try different architectural patterns, and explore ideas. Each project teaches me something new, and I keep them here as a log of my learning journey.
